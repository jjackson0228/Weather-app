# Weather-app

Create a weather application that could retrieve data from the open weather api and display the current weather from an area and a 5-day forecast. Also when you search for a city the search is saved as a clickable button and be able to be clicked to check on the weather for that city. The history is saved in localStorage. You can open the inspect page by right clicking on the page and going to the bottom to inspect and be able to see what has been searched and what is saved in localStorage.
